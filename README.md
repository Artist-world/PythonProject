# PythonProject
Place to store my commits for the Python course.

Hey everyone, it is an initial repository for my Python project. It is a custom social network/messenger aka. Telegram or WhatsApp. 
You know, just a basic client where you can submit your data like e-mail, name, surname etc.

Any third-party contributions are appreciated.
